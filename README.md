## üí° Design Approach

This template follows a **Tailwind-first philosophy** where utility classes handle most styling, while Material UI provides complex interactive components. You could use a monochromatic color scheme for a clean, premium feel that's perfect for SaaS applications. Focus is on shipping quickly while maintaining code quality and visual consistency. Many of these design principles and coding guidelines are detailed in the `copilot-instructions.md` file, which you can freely edit if you're using GitHub Copilot.
